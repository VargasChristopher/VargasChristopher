ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone I'm Chris and this is my phenomenal GitHub!

ðŸ‘€ I've always loved technology from a young age through my father (Who actually works at Peraton now!) 
but over time I found my own love for it which led to me following in his footsteps towards a Computer Science degree! 
Definitely my #1 role model. 

Now enough about my dad let's get into a little bit about me and some of my passions!<br />

I started coding in my sophomore year of high school where I took "Advanced Computer Math" and immediately fell in love with it.
 Since then I've gained a little over five years of coding experience through continuing my high school's computer science track
 as well as my first few years of college CS courses along with my projects and Discord communities I've joined.
 
 Now here's a little taste of some of the things I'm passionate about:<br />
-Traveling, even though I've only gone on two trips alone since turning 21.<br />
-Playing basketball or lifting weights around 4-6 times a week brings me a ton of enjoyment too.<br />
-Focusing on my goal to tremendously improve my overall presence on social media by 2024.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create different web scrapers to help out a 4,000 member Discord community 
that I'm a part of (Scraping Enthusiasts). But I'm also leetcoding a lot in preparation for interviews! 
Iâ€™m also looking to collaborate on learning web scraping techniques and innovations to help my community a bit more, but
I also want to collaborate on any social media content, whether it's YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, or Twitch.
