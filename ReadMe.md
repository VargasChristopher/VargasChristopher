ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone I'm Chris and this is my GitHub!

ðŸ‘€ I've always loved technology from a young age through seeing my father coding and such growing up, 
but over time I found my own love for it which led to me following in his footsteps towards a Computer Science degree!  

Now enough about my dad let's get into a little bit about me and some of my passions!<br />

I started coding in my sophomore year of high school, taking "Advanced Computer Math" and immediately fell in love with it.
 Since then I've gained a little over seven years of coding experience by continuing my high school's computer science track
 as well as the internships and my computer science degree I've completed along with my projects and Discord communities I've joined.
 
 Now here's a little taste of some of the things I'm passionate about:<br />
-Traveling, even though I've only gone on two trips alone since turning 21.<br />
-Playing basketball or lifting weights around 4-6 times a week brings me a ton of enjoyment too.<br />
-Working on my business, Apollo Tech Solutions brings me the most enjoyment.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create different web scrapers to help out a 4,000-member Discord community 
that I'm a part of (Scraping Enthusiasts). But I'm also leetcoding a lot in preparation for interviews! 
Iâ€™m also looking to collaborate on learning web scraping techniques and innovations to help my community a bit more, but
I also want to collaborate on anything related to my business such as web design, digital marketing, etc.
